#### Data Scientist \| Medical Writer \| Board Certified Geriatric Pharmacist

<br/>

I am currently a Research Data Scientist at Precision Analytical where I work on interesting things centered around menopause, hormones, and aging.

My passion lies at the intersection of data science, scientific communication, geriatrics, health disparities, pharmacoeconomics, pharmacoepidemiology, and health outcomes research.

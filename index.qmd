### Data Scientist \| Medical Writer \| Board Certified Geriatric Pharmacist

<br/>

I currently work as a Research Data Scientist at Precision Analytical where I work on interesting things around menopause, hormones, and aging.

My passion lies at the intersection of data, scientific communication, geriatrics, health disparities, pharmacoeconomics, and health outcomes research.
